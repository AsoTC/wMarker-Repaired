# wMarker-Repaired
wMarker WoW add-on updated for 9.1

This is an updated version of the wMarker addon for 9.1 Shadowlands. The original is located here (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/wmarker-addon) and all copyrights are the original creator of thie addon. I just find this add-on really useful for tanking and was sad when it broke in the 9.0 release. I looked up the breaking changes to the Blizzard add-on api and fixed up the application.
